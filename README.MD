To create a Python library that utilizes ACME with Venafi TPP for certificate management, we need to follow the ACME protocol for certificate issuance and renewal. ACME (Automated Certificate Management Environment) is a protocol used to automate interactions with a Certificate Authority (CA), often for obtaining SSL/TLS certificates. Venafi TPP supports ACME for automated certificate management.

Integrating ACME with Venafi TPP
To use ACME with Venafi TPP, you need to:

Set Up an ACME Directory URL: Obtain the ACME directory URL from Venafi TPP, which allows you to interact with the ACME server to request and manage certificates.

Use an ACME Client: Use an ACME client to interact with the ACME server for certificate requests and renewals.
